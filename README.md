<h2>Repository Structure</h2>

<p>The repository is organized to ensure a clear and reproducible workflow, featuring the following key components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Raw Data:</strong><br>
  This folder contains the original count matrices from the GSE94464 dataset. Users can download the raw data from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE94464">this link</a> to trace back to the source, compare results, or conduct alternative analyses.</li>

  <li><strong>Scripts:</strong><br>
  All R scripts used for the analysis are stored here. The scripts are thoroughly documented with comments that explain each step of the process. Users can run these scripts to reproduce the analysis or adapt them for different datasets or research questions.</li>

  <li><strong>Results:</strong><br>
  The results folder includes visualizations, figures, and tables summarizing the key findings of the analysis. This includes heat maps, volcano plots, and other graphical representations that highlight differentially expressed genes and their significance.</li>
